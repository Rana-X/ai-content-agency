# AI Content Agency - Complete LangGraph Learning Project

## Project Overview
• A comprehensive learning project that demonstrates ALL major LangGraph features
• Built as a simplified multi-agent blog writing system
• **Core Flow:** Topic Input → Research (runs in parallel) → Writing → Review (with human approval) → Saved Blog Post

> **Implementation Note:** Phase 2 was built with complete state support for all features (phases 3-12) to avoid future state schema changes. The state is ready for parallel execution, dynamic graphs, and human-in-loop from the start.

• Install core dependencies (LangGraph, LangChain)
• Configure Gemini Pro API key
• Set up Supabase account and database
• Configure LangSmith for monitoring

### Project File Structure
```
project/
├── agents/
├── workflows/

├── requirements.txt
└── .env
```

### Basic Configuration Module

---

## Phase 2: State Management System ✅ COMPLETE

### Core State Model (IMPLEMENTED)
• Created `ContentState` TypedDict with comprehensive fields:
  - Basic fields: `project_id`, `topic`, `status`, `draft`, `final_content`
  - Parallel execution: `parallel_results: Dict[str, Any]`
  - Dynamic graphs: `enable_research`, `enable_revision` flags
  - Human-in-loop: `human_feedback`, `human_approved`
  - Time travel: `checkpoint_history`, `current_checkpoint`
  - Quality control: `quality_score`, `revision_count`, `research_attempts`

### Supabase Integration (IMPLEMENTED)
• Three tables created:
  - `project_states` - Main state with JSONB storage
  - `state_history` - Checkpoint snapshots
  - `human_feedback` - Human review tracking
• Views: `active_projects`, `project_stats`
• Automatic timestamp triggers

### State Storage Module (IMPLEMENTED)
• `state/models.py` - ContentState TypedDict with all fields for phases 3-12
• `state/storage.py` - StateManager with CRUD, checkpoints, human feedback
• Full async/await pattern
• Pre-built support for parallel execution, dynamic graphs, and human-in-loop

NOTE: State implementation is intentionally complete to support all future phases without modification.

## Phase 3: Basic Agent Implementation ✅ COMPLETE

### Four Core Agents (IMPLEMENTED)

#### Manager Agent (`agents/manager.py`) - COMPLETE
• **Purpose**: Initialize and route workflows
• **Implementation Details**:
  - Validates topic (2-50 words, must contain actual words)
  - Cleans input (removes special chars, applies title case)
  - Extracts keywords (max 5, removes stop words)
  - Creates initial ContentState with all fields
  - Routes based on mode: standard → research, quick → writer
• **No External Dependencies**: Pure Python processing

#### Research Agent (`agents/research.py`) - COMPLETE
• **Purpose**: Gather web information
• **Implementation Details**:
  - Uses Brave Search API (replaced DuckDuckGo due to rate limits)
  - Performs single search with max 5 results
  - Extracts descriptions as research_notes
  - Extracts URLs as sources
  - Updates state with research_attempts = 1
• **Error Handling**: Sets status to "research_failed" on API errors

#### Writer Agent (`agents/writer.py`) - COMPLETE
• **Purpose**: Generate blog content
• **Implementation Details**:
  - Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash model
  - Includes 200+ line system prompt with detailed instructions
  - Generates 400-800 word blog posts
  - Works with or without research notes
  - Accurate word counting
• **Output**: Professional blog posts with title, intro, body, conclusion

#### Review Agent (`agents/review.py`) - COMPLETE
• **Purpose**: Evaluate quality (NOT revise content)
• **Implementation Details**:
  - 100-point scoring system (4 categories × 25 points each)
  - Provides exactly 3 feedback comments
  - CRITICAL: Copies draft to final_content unchanged
  - Always routes to "complete" (no conditional logic)
  - Uses regex parsing to extract score and feedback
• **Important**: This agent evaluates but NEVER modifies content

---

## Phase 4: Basic Linear Workflow

### Simple Workflow Implementation
• Create `workflows/basic.py`
• Linear flow: Manager → Research → Writer → Review → End
• No conditionals or loops yet
• Basic state passing between agents

### FastAPI Application Setup
• Create `api/main.py`
• Basic endpoints:
  - `POST /create` - Start new project
  - `GET /status/{project_id}` - Check status
  - `GET /content/{project_id}` - Get final content

### Testing Basic Flow
• Test end-to-end workflow
• Verify state persistence
• Ensure agents communicate properly
• Validate content generation

---

## Phase 5: Research Subgraph Implementation

### Create Research Subgraph
• Move research logic to `workflows/subgraphs/research.py`
• Create three-node subgraph:
  1. Search node - performs searches
  2. Extract node - extracts facts
  3. Summarize node - creates summary

### Integrate Subgraph into Main Workflow
• Replace single research agent with subgraph
• Test subgraph isolation
• Verify data flow through subgraph

---

## Phase 6: Parallel Execution

### Enhance Research with Parallel Searches
• Modify research subgraph for parallel execution
• Implement 3 simultaneous searches:
  - Topic overview search
  - Latest news search
  - Key facts search
• Use `asyncio.gather()` for parallelization

### Update State for Parallel Data
• Add `sources` field to state
• Add `research_notes` list field
• Merge parallel results properly

---

## Phase 7: Complex Routing and Conditionals

### Add Retry Logic to Research
• Add `research_attempts` counter to state
• Implement quality check after research
• Create conditional routing:
  - If sources < 3 and attempts < 2: retry
  - If sources >= 3: proceed
  - If max attempts: proceed anyway

### Add Revision Loop
• Implement review decision logic
• Add conditional edges after review:
  - If quality > 70: complete
  - If quality 40-70: revise
  - If quality < 40: fail
• Add `revision_count` to state

---

## Phase 8: Multiple Workflow Variants

### Create Workflow Factory
• Implement `workflows/factory.py`
• Create `WorkflowFactory` class

### Standard Workflow (`workflows/standard.py`)
• Full feature workflow
• Includes research subgraph
• Has retry logic
• Multiple revision cycles

### Quick Workflow (`workflows/quick.py`)
• Simplified workflow
• Skip research entirely
• Single pass writing
• No revisions

### Dynamic Mode Selection
• Add `mode` field to state
• Update `/create` endpoint for mode selection
• Test both workflow types

---

## Phase 9: Checkpointing and Time Travel

### Enhanced State Structure
• Add checkpoint fields to state:
  - `checkpoint_history`: List of checkpoint IDs
  - `current_checkpoint`: Active checkpoint

### Create Checkpoint System
• Implement `state/checkpoints.py`
• Create checkpoint save function
• Maintain last 10 checkpoints
• Add checkpoint database table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE state_history (
    checkpoint_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id UUID REFERENCES project_states(project_id),
    state_snapshot JSONB,
    checkpoint_name TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Time Travel API Endpoints
• `GET /history/{project_id}` - List checkpoints
• `POST /restore/{project_id}/{checkpoint_id}` - Restore state

### Automatic Checkpointing
• Save checkpoint after each major step
• Name checkpoints descriptively
• Clean up old checkpoints

---

## Phase 10: Human-in-the-Loop

### Add Interruption Points
• Configure workflow to pause before review
• Add `interrupt_before=["review"]` to compilation

### Human Feedback System
• Add `human_feedback` field to state
• Create feedback database table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE human_feedback (
    project_id UUID REFERENCES project_states(project_id),
    feedback TEXT,
    approved BOOLEAN,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Feedback Handling
• Implement `api/human_loop.py`
• Create feedback endpoint:
  - `POST /feedback/{project_id}`
• Handle feedback actions:
  - Approve
  - Request revision
  - Reject

### Resume Workflow Logic
• Implement workflow resume after feedback
• Update state with human input
• Continue or redirect flow based on feedback

---

## Phase 11: Streaming and Real-time Updates
